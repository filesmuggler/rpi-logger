# RPI Logger
Bash script for automatic logging into RPI with SSH for developers tired of manual configuration every time they work with their RPI.

## Requirements 
Before first use make sure to have nmap, ssh, sshpass and net-tools installed.  
For proper operation You MUST provide some data about your RPI.

## Algorithm
Program execution steps:
  - check IP address of your computer (255.255.255.0 mask is assumed)
  - get network address from previously obtained IP address
  - scan network for a host with hostname given by the user
  - get IP address of RPI 
  - connect to RPI with sshpass over SSH

## Setup

1. Download repo.
2. Make sure all tools are installed.
3. Edit raspberry pi hostname, username, password and your network interface variables in the script.
4. Run command:
```
chmod +x rpi-logger.sh
```
5. Add script to the user space, to be executed anywhere in the system.
```
sudo cp rpi-logger.sh /usr/local/bin/
```
6. Run script:
```
./rpi-logger.sh
```

## Known issues

- The script is limited to networks with mask 255.255.255.0.
- It also uses plain password while logging - potential security risk.
